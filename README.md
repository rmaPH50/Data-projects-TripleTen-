 1. Churn Rate

  Description: A telecommunications operator named Interconnect wants to predict their customer churn rate. If it's known that a customer is planning to leave, they will be offered promotional codes and special package options. The marketing team at Interconnect has collected some personal customer data, including information about the data packages they've chosen and their contracts.

2. Gold Modeling Predictive Distribution

   Description: Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling data from the gold recovery industry, with the ultimate goal of predicting recovery efficiency at various stages of the process. The data for this project is provided in three separate files:

1  gold_recovery_train.csv: The training dataset.
2  gold_recovery_test.csv: The test dataset without target values.
3  gold_recovery_full.csv: The complete source dataset containing both the training and test data along with all features.
The datasets are indexed by the date and time of data acquisition, reflecting the temporal nature of the parameters. Parameters measured or calculated at similar times often display correlation. However, due to operational constraints, some features measured or calculated later are missing from the test dataset, while the source dataset contains all features.

3. Taxi Company Time Series

   Description: Sweet Lift Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the amount of taxi orders for the next hour. Build a model for such a prediction.

The RMSE metric on the test set should not be more than 48.

Project instructions
Download the data and resample it by one hour.
Analyze the data.
Train different models with different hyperparameters. The test sample should be 10% of the initial dataset.
Test the data using the test sample and provide a conclusion.

4. Machine Learning for Text

  Description: The Film Junky Union, a new edgy community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system for filtering and categorizing movie reviews. The goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. You'll be using a dataset of IMBD movie reviews with polarity labeling to build a model for classifying positive and negative reviews. It will need to reach an F1 score of at least 0.85.

Project Instructions
Load the data.
Preprocess the data, if required.
Conduct an EDA and make your conclusion on the class imbalance.
Preprocess the data for modeling.
Train at least three different models for the given train dataset.
Test the models for the given test dataset.
Compose a few of your own reviews and classify them with all the models.
Check for differences between the testing results of models in the above two points. Try to explain them.
Present your findings.
